The **Machines in Motion laboratory** conducts fundamental and applied research in robotics. We strive to discover the algorithmic foundations of robotic movements. We believe that understanding how machines should move and interact with unknown environments is central for creating truly autonomous robots. In particular, we aim to conceive general methods applicable to any robots with arms and legs endowing them with the ability to safely perform any locomotion and manipulation tasks in unknown environments and to constantly improve their performances as they experience the world.

The laboratory commits to conducting socially responsible activities and strives to promote applications of robotic technologies that will demonstrably improve quality of life, empower people and generally help create more open and equal societies.
