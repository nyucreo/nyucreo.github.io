The **Riviere Robot Lab** (RRL) develops autonomous robotics research with theory, software, and experiments. 

Our methods are at the intersection of machine learning, discrete and continuous optimization, dynamical systems, and hardware systems. 

Our applications span space robotics, aerial swarms, dexterous manipulation, self-driving cars, and more. 

We are affiliated with New York University's (NYU) Tandon Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Courant Computer Science. We are also affiliated with the Center for Robotics and Embodied Intelligence at NYU.
