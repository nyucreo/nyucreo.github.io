Welcome to New York University‘s **Applied Dynamics and Optimization Laboratory** website. Our lab’s broad research areas include dynamics, control, and optimization of mechanical systems. Main domains for implementations and applications include robotics, biomechanical systems, and their intersections. With on-going and past supports from NSF, NASA, NYU, and industry, current research topics include energetics of dynamic systems (battery expenditure models, energy-efficient design and control), legged balance and gait stability (fall prediction and prevention, balance control, dynamic walking), and integration of dynamics/control with numerical optimization and machine learning/AI (task failure, constraint prioritization, contacts in trajectory optimization). The studies of modeling, design, and control of engineering systems can be extended to better understand more complicated biological systems and to validate nature’s inherent hypotheses. On the other hand, the principles underlying and determining motions and structures of biological systems will provide innovative solutions and inspirations for novel engineering systems toward better functionality, stability, and efficiency. Our research aims at bringing together both robotic and biomechanical systems; we aim to establish mathematical models, quantitative criteria, and algorithmic/computational foundations for their implementations in advancing: (i) design and control of robots and machines and (ii) prediction and analysis of biomechanical systems.
