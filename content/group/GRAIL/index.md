The **General-purpose Robotics and AI Lab (GRAIL)** has the goal of getting robots to generalize and adapt in the messy world we live in. Our research focuses broadly on robot learning and decision making, with an emphasis on large-scale learning (both data and models), representation learning for sensory data, developing algorithms to model actions and behavior, reinforcement learning for adapting to new scenarios, and building open-sourced affordable robots.
