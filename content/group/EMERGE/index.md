The mission of the **EMERGE** lab is to make it easy and efficient to develop capable, safe, and intelligent multi‑agent systems through learning, simulation, and data. We emphasise use‑inspired basic research, turning serious efforts to solve problems in autonomy, systems, and transportation into new algorithms, insights, and discoveries. If there's a unifying thread to our research, it's that the fastest way to understand something is to start building. 🛠️

In practice, our tools consist heavily of scaled reinforcement learning, fast and diverse simulation, human data, and solid engineering. A smattering of interests right now:

🎯 Scaling up search in multi-agent RL
🧠 Getting meta-reinforcement learning working
🚶‍♂️ Designing accurate reactive models of human behavior
🚗 Building an open-source planning stack for a self-driving car
