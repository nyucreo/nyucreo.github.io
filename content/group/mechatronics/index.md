The exciting field of **Mechatronics** - increasingly recognized as a contemporary, integrative design methodology - is serving as a vehicle to engage and stimulate the interest of NYU Tandon students in hands-on, interdisciplinary, collaborative learning. Mechatronics is a synergistic integration of mechanical engineering, control theory, computer science, and electronics to manage complexity, uncertainty, and communication in engineered systems. The typical knowledgebase for the optimal design and operation of Mechatronics and smart systems comprises of system modeling and analysis, decision and control theory, sensors and signal conditioning, actuators and power electronics, hardware interfacing, rapid control prototyping, and embedded computing. The relevant technology applications of Mechatronics include medical, defense, manufacturing, robotics, automotive, and distributed systems and smart consumer products. This web site is aimed at students, educators, and engineers interested in learning, practicing, and promoting the fascinating discipline of Mechatronics. Here you will find ongoing Mechatronics related educational, research, and outreach activities being undertaken by NYU Tandon faculty and students.
