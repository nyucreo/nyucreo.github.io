This project focuses on creating autonomous service robots capable of performing complex tasks in human environments. Our robots can navigate dynamically changing spaces, interact safely with humans, and adapt their behavior based on contextual understanding.

## Key Features

- Advanced navigation and obstacle avoidance
- Human-robot interaction capabilities
- Task planning and execution
- Real-time environment mapping
- Safety-first design principles

## Applications

- Elderly care assistance
- Hospital logistics
- Restaurant and hotel services
- Office environment support
