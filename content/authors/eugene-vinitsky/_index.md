I'm an Assistant Professor at NYU Tandon based in Civil Engineering and an affiliation with Computer Science. I received my PhD in control and reinforcement learning from UC Berkeley with Alexandre Bayen during which I spent time at Apple, Tesla, Deepmind, and Facebook AI Research. My research goal is to see complex, human-like behavior emerge from unsupervised interaction between groups of learning agents with an applications focus on robotics and transportation. Concretely this leads to a lot of questions I'm currently interested in:

- How can we use RL to design models of human agents? How can we ensure that RL designed agents are human-compatible?
- How can we synthesize environments that push and test the capabilities of our agents?
- What algorithmic advances and software tools are why we haven't solved all this already?

In practice this means working on understanding how to push the state of the art in multi-agent RL algorithms, designing new data-driven simulators, and trying to deploy simulator-designed controllers into real-world systems.
