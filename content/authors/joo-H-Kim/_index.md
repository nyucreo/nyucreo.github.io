Dr. Joo H. Kim is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at New York University (NYU) and affiliated faculty of NYU’s Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) and NYU-KAIST Global Innovation and Research Institute. Dr. Kim directs the Applied Dynamics and Optimization Laboratory for the broad areas of dynamics, control, and optimization of mechanical systems. With applications in robotic and biomechanical systems, his current research topics include the energetics of dynamic systems, legged balance and gait stability, and integration of dynamics/control with numerical optimization and machine learning/AI. Dr. Kim’s research has been sponsored by NSF, NASA, NYU, industry, and international collaborators. He received a Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering in 2006, and M.S. degrees in mathematics, mechanical engineering, and biomedical engineering, all from the University of Iowa, and a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, South Korea. Before joining NYU in 2009, he was an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering and a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at the Center for Computer-Aided Design at the University of Iowa. Dr. Kim is a Fellow of ASME and a Senior Member of IEEE. His current and past roles as an Associate Editor include the ASME Journal of Mechanical Design, the ASME Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics, and the Conference Editorial Board of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. Dr. Kim is the recipient of several awards and honors, including the 2007 Top Government Technology of the Year Award from the State of Iowa, the 2014 Advanced Modeling and Simulation Best Paper Award from the ASME Computers and Information in Engineering Division, the 2015 Freudenstein/General Motors Young Investigator Award from the ASME Design Engineering Division, and the 2020 Associate Editor Award from the ASME Journal of Mechanical Design.
